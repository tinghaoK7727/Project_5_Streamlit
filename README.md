# Project_5_Streamlit


**Project Goal:**

The goal of this project is to take existing data, clean it, find ingsights and meaningful correlations and finally create a dashboard via streamlit and delpoy it online. 


**Dataset:**

A dataset of 304 rows and 14 columns about data on the tendency of heart attack and various indicators such as age, gender, fasting blood sugar and maximum heartbeat level etc. All the datas we have are numeric and non of the cells contain NaN values. 


**Data Cleaning:**

As our data contains only numeric values, there is not much data cleaning needed. Based on information found online, we have decided to replace all the numeric values in the gender column in order to faciliate further data analysis and interpretation.


**Storytelling tactics:**

Our target audience for the dashboard would be public health institutions wishing to grasp some information about the population regarding heart attacks and its potential causes andd possible triggers. Through reviewing the dashboard, the audience should be able to know what element are more prompt to cause heart attacks and what are not necessarily related.


**Data exploration:**

By applying a correlation heatmap, we found that there are some correlations between certain columns: (XXX)
We have discovered that the tendency of heart attack is the most related to XXXXXX and we would based on this observation to build our dashboard.


**Charts and Widgets:**



**Conclusions:**
